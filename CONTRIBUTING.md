# Contributing to Tamnza
Looking to **contribute code** to Tamnza? Great! You landed on the right place and we appreciate you for taking the time.

Also, always keep in mind that for many of us English is not our native language. What might come across as discourteous is probably an unintended side effect of the language barrier. Usage of emoticons is highly encouraged. They are great to convey, er, emotions and state of mind.

## Getting Started
The project is structured on the model MVC (Model View Controller).


## Reviews
Reviews are a great way to get familiar with the codebase.

## Pull request guidelines
* **Create topic branches**. Never ever open a pull request from your master branch. **Ever!**
* **One topic branch per change**. Found something that needs fixing but is unrelated to the current work? Create a new topic branch and open another *pull request*.
* **Use a coherent commit history**. Make sure each individual commit in your *pull request* is meaningful and organized in logical chunks. Tidy up and squash commits before submitting.
* **Be descriptive, but concise**. The *pull request* and commits should have a useful title and follow the `[component(s)] Short description...` format. No, `[README.md] Update` is **not** descriptive enough. The *pull request* description should only contain information relevant to the change.
* **Be patient, be kind, rewind**. We're all volunteers with busy lives but usually very responsive in cataloging *pull requests* and pinging the relevant maintainer(s). Sometimes though, things go unnoticed for longer than usual. Probably due to beer deprivation... or lack thereof. Feel free to nudge us if we forget.

## Coding guidelines
* **Follow our [code guidelines](CODE_GUIDELINES.md)**. New code should follow those guidelines even if existing code doesn't. If you're up to it, improve existing code and submit it in separate commits.
* **Document the code**. You know you're brilliant, but maybe you'd like to understand what you did a year from now. Or, code God forbid, help others... Nope, `// Magic. Do not touch!` does not count as documentation.
* **Separate code from cosmetics**. Code and cosmetic changes should be in separate commits. It's already hard to review code without added noise. Of course, deleting a **few** trailing spaces does not warrant a separate commit. Use your judgement.
* **Test your changes**.

## Updating your PR
Making a *pull request* adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that they'd like changed, they'll ask you to edit your *pull request* before it gets merged. **There's no need to open a new *pull request*, just edit the existing one**.
